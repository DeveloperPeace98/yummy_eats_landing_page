# yummy_eats_landing_page
This is the final version of a mock landing page i did for a fast food website.
In this repository there is a folder for the images, an HTML file and a CSS file.
THere was not a lot of Javascript used so the javascript element is embedded into the HTML file instead of having its own external file.
